# variables while honoring existing values of pertinent
# environment variables:
#
# Architecture-related variables such as DEB_TARGET_MULTIARCH:
#include /usr/share/dpkg/architecture.mk
# Vendor-related variables such as DEB_VENDOR:
#include /usr/share/dpkg/vendor.mk
# Package-related variables such as DEB_DISTRIBUTION
#include /usr/share/dpkg/pkg-info.mk

# You may alternatively set them susing a simple script such as:
# DEB_VENDOR ?= $(shell dpkg-vendor --query  Vendor)
